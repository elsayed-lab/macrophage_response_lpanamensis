## This file is intended to document my first container installation
## of every R prerequisite via renv.  Once complete I will use renv's
## snapshot function to create its json file which will then be included
## with the container recipe and invoked from within the container installation
## via renv's restore.  The starting point for this script is a reasonably minimal
## singularity instance with a blank R, build-essential, and some known prerequisites.

## The primary motivation for this document is the fact that all my containers exploded
## on 20240501.  Suddenly, none of my containers were able to successfully build because
## bioconductor changed versions of many of the prerequisites to versions which simply
## do not install.  As a result, I decided to re-evaluate how I install these prerequisites
## and remove the assumption that installing/using a specific bioconductor version would
## result in a set/usable set of packages.
##
## As a result, I decided to once again try renv.  I previously tried this for a project
## and found it a bit unsatisfactory, just because at the time I thought having extra
## copies of everything across packages too onerous.  However, if I am going to go to the
## trouble of installing a full toolchain for the container, then I will -by-definition-
## have all the packages installed in it, so that complaint is a bit stupid.

## With the above in mind, I am going to write in the following R script with each
## installation command used to get renv set up followed by whatever tasks are required
## to get me all the prerequisite packages for this container.

## If any of the resulting packages require the installation of stuff via apt/conda, then
## I will put them here, before the R script.
